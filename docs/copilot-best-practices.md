# GitHub Copilot Best Practices - Baddie AI Journal

Master AI-assisted development for the Baddie AI Journal project. This guide provides proven strategies for writing better code faster while maintaining our high quality standards.

## 🎯 Effective Prompt Engineering

### Context-Rich Comments
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Specific context for journaling app
# Calculate 30-day mood trend for insights dashboard using weighted average
# considering entry frequency, mood intensity, and recency bias
def calculate_mood_trend(entries: List[JournalEntry]) -> MoodTrend:
    # Copilot generates sophisticated analytics logic
```

```python
# ❌ POOR: Generic context leads to basic suggestions
# Calculate mood trend
def calculate_mood_trend(entries):
    # Copilot generates simple, generic code
```

### Domain-Specific Vocabulary
Use project terminology consistently to get better suggestions:

```python
# Baddie AI Journal specific terms that improve suggestions:
# - journal entries, mood tracking, streak calculation
# - viral sharing, referral payouts, growth analytics
# - insights dashboard, tag analysis, category breakdown
# - user onboarding, gamification, milestone celebrations
```

### Function-Level Context
```python
def process_referral_payout(referral_id: str, payment_amount: float) -> PayoutResult:
    """
    Process $5 referral payout with fraud prevention for viral growth program.
    
    Validates payment authenticity, checks for duplicate referrals, updates
    user balance, and triggers notification. Includes ML-based fraud detection
    for suspicious patterns like IP duplication or rapid signups.
    
    Args:
        referral_id: Unique identifier for the referral transaction
        payment_amount: Amount of the qualifying payment (must be > $0)
        
    Returns:
        PayoutResult with success status, amount credited, and fraud score
    """
    # Copilot will generate comprehensive payout logic with security measures
```

## 🛠️ Code Quality with AI Assistance

### Review AI-Generated Code
Always review Copilot suggestions for:

#### Security Concerns
```python
# ❌ Potential security issue in AI suggestion
def get_user_journal_entries(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM entries WHERE user_id = {user_id}"
    # SQL injection vulnerability!
    
# ✅ Secure version after review
def get_user_journal_entries(user_id: int) -> List[JournalEntry]:
    query = "SELECT * FROM entries WHERE user_id = %s"
    return db.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

#### Performance Optimization
```python
# ❌ Inefficient AI suggestion
def calculate_all_user_streaks():
    users = get_all_users()
    for user in users:
        calculate_streak(user.id)  # N+1 query problem
        
# ✅ Optimized version after review
def calculate_all_user_streaks():
    # Batch process streaks for better performance
    entries = get_all_entries_with_users()
    return batch_calculate_streaks(entries)
```

#### Error Handling
```python
# ✅ Comprehensive error handling for referral system
def create_referral_link(user_id: int) -> ReferralLink:
    """Generate unique referral link with comprehensive error handling"""
    try:
        # Copilot suggests link generation logic
        pass
    except DuplicateReferralError:
        # Handle existing referral codes
        pass
    except DatabaseError as e:
        # Log error and provide fallback
        logger.error(f"Database error creating referral: {e}")
        raise ReferralServiceUnavailable()
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch-all with monitoring
        monitor.track_error("referral_creation_failed", {"user_id": user_id})
        raise
```

### Testing AI-Generated Code
```python
# Test-driven development with Copilot assistance
def test_mood_analytics_accuracy():
    """Test mood calculation accuracy with edge cases"""
    # Given: Sample journal entries with known mood patterns
    test_entries = [
        JournalEntry(mood="happy", date="2024-01-01"),
        JournalEntry(mood="sad", date="2024-01-02"),
        JournalEntry(mood="excited", date="2024-01-03")
    ]
    
    # When: Calculate mood analytics
    analytics = MoodAnalyzer(test_entries)
    result = analytics.calculate_trend()
    
    # Then: Verify expected results
    assert result.dominant_mood == "happy"
    assert result.volatility_score > 0.5  # Mixed emotions
    assert result.improvement_trend == False  # Declining pattern
    
    # Copilot helps generate comprehensive test scenarios
```

## 🔄 Iterative Development with AI
