use 'github/copilot.vim'
```

#### 2. Sign In and Authenticate
1. Open your IDE and sign in to GitHub Copilot
2. Authorize the application when prompted
3. Verify installation with a test suggestion

#### 3. Project-Specific Configuration

**VS Code Settings** (`.vscode/settings.json`):
```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "yaml": true,
    "markdown": true,
    "python": true,
    "javascript": true
  },
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "length": 500,
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "top_p": 0.9
  },
  "github.copilot.inlineSuggest.enable": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.localeOverride": "en"
}
```

## üéØ Baddie Journal Specific Patterns

### Domain Context Setup
Create comments at the top of files to provide context:

```python
"""
Baddie AI Journal - Personal Growth & Analytics Platform
This module handles journal entry analytics and insights generation.
Features: mood tracking, streak calculation, growth metrics, viral sharing.
"""
```

### Smart Code Patterns

#### 1. Journal Entry Models
```python
# Create a journal entry model with mood tracking and analytics support
class JournalEntry:
    """Journal entry with mood analytics and growth tracking"""
    # Copilot will suggest appropriate fields and methods
```

#### 2. Analytics Functions
```python
# Calculate user's journaling streak for insights dashboard
def calculate_streak(user_entries: List[JournalEntry]) -> int:
    """
    Calculate consecutive days of journaling for user engagement metrics.
    Used in insights dashboard and gamification features.
    """
    # Copilot will suggest efficient streak calculation logic
```

#### 3. Referral System
```python
# Implement $5 referral payout system with fraud prevention
class ReferralManager:
    """Manages $5 referral payouts with fraud detection"""
    # Copilot will suggest secure referral tracking methods
```

### Context-Aware Prompting

#### Writing Effective Comments
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific context for better suggestions
# Calculate mood trends for the last 30 days using weighted average
# considering journal entry frequency and sentiment analysis

# ‚ùå Poor: Vague context leads to generic suggestions
# Calculate mood trends
```

#### Function Documentation
```python
def analyze_growth_patterns(entries: List[JournalEntry], timeframe: int = 30) -> GrowthAnalysis:
    """
    Analyze personal growth patterns from journal entries for insights dashboard.
    
    This function powers the viral growth features by identifying positive trends
    that users can share on social media. Includes mood progression, goal achievement,
    and breakthrough moments detection.
    
    Args:
        entries: List of journal entries sorted by date
        timeframe: Number of days to analyze (default 30)
        
    Returns:
        GrowthAnalysis object with shareable insights and visualizations
    """
    # Copilot will suggest comprehensive growth analysis logic
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow with Copilot

### 1. Feature Development
```python
# Step 1: Write descriptive comment about the feature
# Implement viral sharing feature for journal insights with privacy controls

# Step 2: Let Copilot suggest the class structure
class ViralSharingManager:
    # Copilot suggests methods and properties
    
# Step 3: Implement methods with guided assistance
def create_shareable_insight(self, insight_data: InsightData) -> ShareableContent:
    # Copilot suggests implementation based on context
```

### 2. Testing with AI Assistance
```python
# Generate comprehensive test cases for mood analytics
def test_mood_analytics():
    """Test mood calculation algorithms for accuracy and edge cases"""
    # Copilot will suggest test scenarios and assertions
```

### 3. Documentation Generation
```python
# Auto-generate API documentation for insights endpoints
# Copilot can help create OpenAPI specs and examples
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Sensitive Data Protection
```python
# Copilot configuration to avoid suggesting hardcoded secrets
# Add .copilotignore file for sensitive directories
```

**.copilotignore:**
```
.env
.env.local
secrets/
credentials/
*.key
*.pem
config/production.py
```

### Input Validation Patterns
```python
# Secure input validation for journal entries to prevent XSS
def sanitize_journal_content(content: str) -> str:
    """Sanitize user input for safe storage and display"""
    # Copilot will suggest security-focused validation logic
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Database Query Patterns
```python
# Optimize database queries for analytics dashboard performance
def get_user_insights_optimized(user_id: int, days: int = 30) -> InsightData:
    """Fetch user insights with optimized queries for viral load capacity"""
    # Copilot suggests efficient query patterns
```

### Caching Strategies
```python
# Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed insights
@cache_result(ttl=3600)  # 1 hour cache
def calculate_expensive_analytics(user_id: int) -> AnalyticsResult:
    # Copilot suggests caching-aware implementation
```

## üêõ Debugging with Copilot Chat

### Common Debugging Scenarios
1. **Ask Copilot Chat:** "Why isn't my streak calculation working?"
2. **Code Explanation:** Select code and ask "Explain this function"
3. **Bug Fixes:** "Find potential bugs in this referral logic"
4. **Optimization:** "How can I make this analytics query faster?"

### Chat Commands
```
/explain - Explain selected code
/fix - Suggest fixes for bugs
/tests - Generate test cases
/docs - Create documentation
/optimize - Performance improvements
```
