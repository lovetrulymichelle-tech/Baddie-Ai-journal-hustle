## Insights Feature

**ðŸŽ‰ [Click here to preview the working implementation!](PREVIEW.md)**

The Insights feature provides analytics on your journal entries to help you track patterns, moods, and productivity over time.

### What Insights Show You
- **Streaks:** See how many consecutive days youâ€™ve written entries.
- **Daily Counts:** Track your journaling frequency over the last 30 days (customizable).
- **Mood & Category Breakdown:** Visualize the distribution of your moods and categories.
- **Top Tags:** Discover which tags you use most (set your own limit for top results).
- **Totals & Metrics:** Total entries, unique tags/categories, and average writing frequency.

### How It Works
- Data is analyzed in real-time from your journal entries.
- All times are stored and calculated in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) for consistency across time zones.
- CSV export is available for deeper analysis or backup.

### Example Usage
```python
from datetime import datetime
from baddie_journal.models import JournalEntry, InsightData
from baddie_journal.insights import InsightsHelper

# Sample entries
entries = [
    JournalEntry(1, "Great day!", "happy", "personal", ["motivation"], datetime.utcnow()),
    JournalEntry(2, "Productive work", "focused", "work", ["productivity"], datetime.utcnow())
]

helper = InsightsHelper(InsightData(entries))
print(f"Current streak: {helper.calculate_streak()} days")
print(f"Mood breakdown: {helper.get_mood_breakdown()}")
print(f"Top tags: {helper.get_top_tags(5)}")
```

### Interpreting Your Insights
- **Streaks:** Longer streaks mean more consistent journaling.
- **Mood breakdown:** Shows your emotional trendsâ€”use to spot highs/lows or triggers.
- **Top tags:** Reveals what topics or feelings dominate your journaling.

### Export & Privacy
- You can export your insights as a CSV.
- Analytics are private and visible only to you.
