## Best Practices

### For Best AI Results

1. **Be Specific**: Provide as much detail as possible about the item
2. **Include Measurements**: Add dimensions when relevant
3. **Be Honest About Condition**: Transparency builds trust
4. **Know Your Audience**: Specify who would want this item
5. **Provide Context**: Original price helps AI understand value
6. **List All Features**: Don't leave out important details

### Product Photography Tips

Based on AI suggestions, capture:
- **Front view**: Main product shot with clean background
- **Back/Side views**: Show all angles
- **Detail shots**: Close-ups of materials, tags, unique features
- **Condition indicators**: Show any wear transparently
- **Scale reference**: Include size context when helpful

### Pricing Strategy

ThriftGenius considers:
- **New retail equivalents**: Similar items sold new
- **Used market comparables**: What similar used items sell for
- **Condition premium/discount**: Based on your item's condition
- **Brand value**: Recognized brands command higher prices
- **High-end positioning**: Professional presentation adds value

## Troubleshooting

### "AI Analysis Not Available"

**Cause**: OpenAI API key not configured or packages not installed

**Solutions**:
1. Set environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'`
2. Install packages: `pip install swarms openai`
3. Restart the Flask application

**Note**: Without AI, you'll still get basic product information display

### API Rate Limits

If you hit OpenAI rate limits:
- Wait a few moments before trying again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan
- Process products in smaller batches

### Slow Response Times

AI analysis takes 10-30 seconds per product because:
- Multiple specialized agents are working
- Market research is being simulated
- Comprehensive analysis is being performed

**This is normal!** The quality of results justifies the wait.
