# Baddie AI Journal Hustle

Baddie AI Journal Hustle is a Python-based journaling application with AI-powered insights, mood tracking, and analytics features. The application provides streak tracking, mood analysis, tagging systems, CSV export capabilities, and subscription management.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Current Repository State

**PRODUCTION READY**: This repository contains a fully functional web application with Flask, database integration, AI analysis capabilities, and deployment configuration. The application is ready for deployment to Railway or other cloud platforms.

### Key Components

### Example Usage Patterns

**Web Application Usage:**
```bash
# Start the web server
python app.py

# Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in browser for:
# - Creating new journal entries
# - Viewing all entries
# - Analytics dashboard with insights
# - Exporting data
```

**Programmatic Usage:**
```python
from datetime import datetime, UTC
from baddie_journal.models import JournalEntry, InsightData
from baddie_journal.insights import InsightsHelper

# Create journal entries - Note: Use datetime.now(UTC) instead of deprecated utcnow()
entries = [
    JournalEntry(1, "Great day!", "happy", "personal", ["motivation"], datetime.now(UTC)),
    JournalEntry(2, "Productive work", "focused", "work", ["productivity"], datetime.now(UTC))
]

# Generate insights
helper = InsightsHelper(InsightData(entries))
print(f"Current streak: {helper.calculate_streak()} days")
print(f"Mood breakdown: {helper.get_mood_breakdown()}")  
print(f"Top tags: {helper.get_top_tags(5)}")

# Export to CSV
csv_data = helper.export_to_csv()
```

**AI-Enhanced Analysis (when available):**
```python
from baddie_journal.swarms_integration import JournalAnalysisSwarm

# Initialize AI analysis (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
swarm = JournalAnalysisSwarm(api_key="your-api-key")
insights = swarm.generate_comprehensive_analysis(insight_data)
recommendations = swarm.generate_recommendations(insight_data, insights)
```

## Validation and Testing

### Testing the Application
Always create and activate a virtual environment before testing:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run Built-in Test Scripts:**
```bash
python test_swarms.py       # Test AI integration and core models - NEVER CANCEL: May take 2-5 minutes
python test_subscription.py # Test subscription features - NEVER CANCEL: May take 2-5 minutes  
python demo.py              # Run complete functionality demo - NEVER CANCEL: May take 2-5 minutes
```

**Manual Web Application Testing:**
```bash
python app.py  # Start server, then test in browser:
```
- Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 for home page with entry form
- Test journal entry creation with different moods and tags
- Visit insights page to verify analytics calculations
- Test entry listing and search functionality
- Verify CSV export works correctly

**Database Testing:**
```bash
# Test database connectivity and operations
python -c "from database import DatabaseManager; db = DatabaseManager(); print('Database OK')"
```

### Linting and Code Quality (When Available)
```bash
# Check if linting tools are available, then run:
python -m flake8 baddie_journal/ app.py database.py  # Style checking
python -m pylint baddie_journal/                     # Code analysis
python -m black --check .                            # Format checking
```

### Current State Validation
- ✅ Repository structure is complete and functional
- ✅ Web application starts successfully
- ✅ Database layer works with fallback support
- ✅ Core business logic is implemented and tested
- ✅ Templates and UI are responsive and functional
- ✅ Deployment configuration is ready (Procfile, requirements.txt)

## Common Tasks

### Starting the Application
```bash
# Web interface (recommended)
python app.py  # Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000

# Demo mode
python demo.py  # Command-line demonstration

# Testing
python test_swarms.py      # Test AI features
python test_subscription.py # Test subscription system
```

### Development Workflow

**For Bug Fixes:**
1. Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Reproduce the issue using web app or test scripts
4. Make minimal changes to fix the specific issue
5. Test the fix: Run relevant test script or manually verify in web app
6. Ensure no regressions in core functionality

**For New Features:**
1. Set up environment (as above)
2. Test current functionality with `python app.py`
3. Make incremental changes to business logic in `baddie_journal/`
4. Update web interface in templates if needed
5. Test thoroughly with `python demo.py` and manual web testing
6. Update tests if new test scripts are needed

**For Deployment:**
1. Ensure all core dependencies in requirements.txt
2. Test local deployment: `python app.py`
3. Use deployment documentation in `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md`
4. Configure environment variables as documented

### Database Management
```bash
# Check database status
python -c "from database import DatabaseManager; print(DatabaseManager().get_entry_count(), 'entries')"

# Reset database (if needed)
rm -f *.db journal.db test.db  # Remove local SQLite files
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Import errors**: Check virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
- **Database errors**: Application has fallback to in-memory storage
- **AI features not working**: Optional - app works without swarms/openai
- **Subscription features not working**: Optional - core journaling works without stripe
- **Web app won't start**: Check Flask is installed and port 5000 is available

## Development Workflow

**For New Development:**
1. Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Test current functionality: `python app.py` and visit web interface
4. Make changes to appropriate layer:
   - Business logic: `baddie_journal/` directory
   - Web interface: `templates/` and routes in `app.py`
   - Database: `database.py` or models in `baddie_journal/models/`
5. Test changes immediately: Run test scripts and manual testing
6. Verify no regressions with complete demo: `python demo.py`

**For Bug Fixes:**
1. Set up environment (steps 1-2 above)
2. Reproduce the issue with test scripts or web interface
3. Make minimal targeted changes
4. Verify fix resolves the specific issue
5. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Important Notes

### Testing Guidelines
- **NEVER CANCEL** any test runs - they may take 5+ minutes to complete
- Always test with virtual environment activated
- Test both web interface (`python app.py`) and command-line (`python demo.py`)
- Optional features (AI, subscriptions) should gracefully degrade when dependencies unavailable

### Architecture Principles
- **Database**: Uses SQLAlchemy with graceful fallback to in-memory storage
- **Dependencies**: Core features work without optional dependencies (AI, payments)
- **Timestamps**: All timestamps handled in UTC as per application design
- **Privacy**: Application focuses on personal journaling with privacy as priority
- **Security**: Web interface includes basic security measures, extensible for production

### Deployment Notes
- **Railway Ready**: Procfile and environment configuration included
- **Database Support**: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development
- **Environment Variables**: Documented in deployment guides
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint available for monitoring
- **Scaling**: Designed to support multiple users with subscription system

### Quick Deployment Checklist
1. **Local Testing**: `python app.py` - verify web interface works
2. **Environment Variables**: Set `SECRET_KEY` for Flask sessions
3. **Database**: Optional PostgreSQL connection for production persistence
4. **Optional Features**: AI requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`, subscriptions need Stripe keys
5. **Railway Deployment**: Push to repository, Railway detects Procfile automatically

### Health and Monitoring
- **Health Endpoint**: GET `/health` returns JSON with system status
- **Database Check**: Health endpoint includes database connectivity status
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working if optional services fail
- **Error Handling**: Web interface includes user-friendly error pages
