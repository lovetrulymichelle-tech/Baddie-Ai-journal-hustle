   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug Fixes**: Found a bug? Submit a fix!
- **Feature Development**: New features that enhance the application
- **Documentation**: Improvements to docs, comments, or examples
- **Testing**: Additional test cases or test infrastructure improvements
- **Performance**: Optimizations and performance improvements

### Before Starting Work

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Look for existing issues or create a new one
2. **Discuss Major Changes**: For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. **Claim an Issue**: Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
4. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-export`, `fix/streak-calculation`)

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Code Quality Tools

We use the following tools (check .flake8 for configuration):
```bash
# Check code style
flake8 .

# Format code (if black is installed)
black .
```

### Documentation

- Update docstrings when modifying functions
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update .github/copilot-instructions.md for architecture changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Core functionality tests
python test_swarms.py

# Subscription system tests
python test_subscription.py

# Deployment verification
python check_deployment.py

# Full application demo
python demo.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Test files use direct Python execution (not pytest)
- Include both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names and output messages
- Tests should be self-contained and not depend on external state

### Test Coverage

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure bug fixes include regression tests
- Test both happy path and edge cases

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Run All Tests**
   ```bash
   python check_deployment.py
   python test_swarms.py
   python test_subscription.py
   ```

3. **Check Code Style**
   ```bash
   flake8 .
   ```

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Update docstrings
   - Add comments for complex changes

   ```bash
   python test_swarms.py
   python test_subscription.py
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
   ```

5. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```bash
